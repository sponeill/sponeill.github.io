        <div class="About">
            <p> Hello! My name is Shane and I am a Web Developer in the Cleveland/Akron region. In some other corners of the internet
                my goal here would have been convincing you to cast me in your new Broadway show. However, after earning my Masters Degree in Musical Theatre from NYU
                and spending several years as an actor and teacher, I chose to attend Tech Elevator and pivot careers into the world of software development.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am currently working towards completing the .NET Development Bootcamp at Tech Elevator, and will soon be looking to for a position as a Junior
                Developer. My previous career path placed a strong emphasis on creativity and collaboration. I am hoping to cary those skills forward into my new career as a 
                developer.
              </p>
